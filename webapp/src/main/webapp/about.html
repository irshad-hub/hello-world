<body>
With over 3 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer, I have honed my skills in AWS, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux. I have actively managed and improved cloud infrastructure on AWS EC2, S3, and RDS, including backup patches and scaling. My experience extends to administration and maintenance of Source control management systems such as GitHub, SubVersion(SVN). I have designed and maintained Jenkins pipelines to automate build test and deployment processes, reducing manual interventions. My expertise in implementing Infrastructure as a code using Ansible has ensured consistent and repeatable deployments across various environments. I have also worked with Docker Images, Docker Hub, Docker registries, and cloud Kubernetes. My efforts in automating deployment tasks resulted in a 20% reduction in deployment failures.
